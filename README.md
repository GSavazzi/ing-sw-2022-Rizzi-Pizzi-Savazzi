## Test Coverage:


| Coverage   | Class | Method | Lines |
|------------|-------|--------|-------|
| Model      | 100%  | 92%    | 86%   |
| Controller | 100%  | 100%   | 82%   |

## Executables

Project runnables consist of three Jars:
* Server Jar
* CLI Jar
* GUI Jar

### Jar Testing:
|            | Windows | Linux  |  Mac (M1 Architecture) |
|------------|---------|--------|-----------------------|
| Server Jar | &#129001; | &#129001; |   &#129001;                    |
| CLI Jar    |  &#129001; |  &#129001;|  &#129001;                    |
| GUI Jar    |  &#129001; | &#129001;|   &#129001;               |

&#129001;: Tested

### Requirements for running Jars
All jars require at least Java JDK 17.
## Server
Server.jar can be runned from terminal. It should work out of the box for any operating system.
## GUI
GUI.jar can be started from a terminal or by launching the jar as an application. It should also work out of the box.
## CLI
CLI version requires UTF-8 Encoding to be displayed correctly. 
* It should be automatically displayed correctly on Mac OS and Linux terminals.
* If you are a Windows user:
  * To display everything correctly you have to enable UTF-8 Encoding by switching character encoding to codepage 65001.
  * All setup can be avoided by using another terminal (E.g. ConEmu, https://conemu.github.io/) and by executing "chcp 65001" command before running the jar.
  
Application may require resizing terminal or changing colour palette to have a better experience.
