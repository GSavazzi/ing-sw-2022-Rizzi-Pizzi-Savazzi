## Test Coverage:


| Coverage   | Class | Method | Lines |
|------------|-------|--------|-------|
| Model      | 100%  | 92%    | 86%   |
| Controller | 100%  | 100%   | 82%   |

## Executables

Project deployment consists of three jars:
* Server Jar
* CLI Jar
* GUI Jar

### Jar Testing:
|            | Windows | Linux  |  Mac (M1 Architecture) |
|------------|---------|--------|-----------------------|
| Server Jar | &#129001; | &#129001; |   &#129001;                    |
| CLI Jar    |  &#129001; |  &#129001;|  &#129001;                    |
| GUI Jar    |  &#129001; | &#129001;|   &#129001;               |

&#129001;: Tested
&#128999;: Not completely tested

### Requirements for CLI
* For windows 11 run the CLI jar on the powershell, for earlier versions the applications run with ConEmu without any problem. https://conemu.github.io/
* Before running the jar on windows enter "chcp 65001" to show UTF-8 Encoding.
* Some screens may be too small to render the CLI correctly. To solve the problem just reduce the font size.
